            <p>
                At Academy of Learning Career College, we are committed to supporting a safe, supportive, and equitable return to classes this September. We have implemented a four-stage plan, in line with the Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Trainingâ€™s COVID-19
                Return-to-Campus Guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below you will find a quick summary of the actions required in each stage, as well as which stage our campuses are currently in. Our goal is to limit the transmission of the virus while maintaining the best possible learning, teaching, and working environment
                for everyone.
