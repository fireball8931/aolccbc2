                <p>Last Modified: March 14, 2022</p>
                <p>As per instructions from the Provincial Health Officer and WorkSafeBC, Academy of Learning has implemented the following policies.
                    <br />
                    <h2>NOTE: As of March 14th, 2022, Masks/Face Coverings are now Optional. For more info, please see the Public Health Officer's Orders <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/info/restrictions#masks"> here</a></h2>
                    <br> For reference, please see WorkSafeBC's page on this policy at <a href="https://www.worksafebc.com/en/covid-19/bcs-four-step-restart">https://www.worksafebc.com/en/covid-19/bcs-four-step-restart</a>
                    <br /><b>Summary of Changes:</b> Under advice from the Provincial Health Officer and WorkSafeBC, most of the COVID-19 era policies are hereby recinded. The remaining policies have been rolled into our new Communicable Disease Prevention
                    Policies and Procedures.
                    <br />Note that we expect <i>Step 4</i> to start Sept 7, 2021, however most of these policies will remain in force beyond this date. Temporary Policies will be marked.</p>
