    <h1 id="our-training-philosophy">Our Training Philosophy</h1>
    <p>You will find when you begin your classes that the people who make up the student body come from a wide range of backgrounds. Each person brings a life experience that can and should be shared.</p>
    <p>Your time at AOLCC will help you make the transition from your high school days, your homemaking days or your past job experiences to a new career. By the time you graduate, you will have acquired the technical skills and work habits that are required
        for employment success.</p>
    <p>Our programs are designed not only to develop technical skills but also to develop the qualities that employers want, initiative, discipline, the ability to solve problems and to be able to work independently. For this reason, we intentionally create
        and foster an office-like environment in our classroom. Consequently, our codes of conduct, policies and regulations have been developed with the &quot;employer-employee&quot; relationship in mind.</p>
    <p>In addition to the qualities listed above, employers want employees with great attitudes. Attitudes cannot be taught; they can only be refined. It is for this reason that we place much of the responsibility for your progress squarely on you.</p>
    <h1 id="government-registration-licencing-and-trademarks">Government Registration, Licencing, and Trademarks</h1>

    <h2 id="work-experiencefield-placement">Work Experience/Field Placement</h2>
    <p>With the primary exception of a small selection of healthcare programs, Academy of Learning® Career College Diplomas, Certificates and individual courses do not include Work Experience or Field Placement.</p>
    <p>Where the college offers programs that include Work Experience or Field Placement, the suitability of the facility is based jointly on the decision of the college Director, Instructors and the suppliers of the specialty portions of the student's enrolled
        program of study, whose expertise and input is essential for the proper management of this segment of the programs.</p>
    <p>Eligible students in healthcare related programs will receive a clinical placement in a &quot;medical/administrative setting&quot;. Placements will be made based on the student's choice of program, host availability, and geographic location. Students
        must be prepared to work shifts and to travel a reasonable distance to their placement site.</p>
    <p>To ensure that the placement site will provide a relevant work experience for the student, the original agreement outlines what the workplace will provide and what is expected of the student.</p>
    <p>A staff person from the college will ensure that the work experience is relevant to the student learning and that the site and its environment are safe.</p>
    <p>To participate in a clinical placement is a privilege for a student and there are expectations that appropriate work ethics will always be displayed. Final grading of the work experience is based on the final evaluation by the Host, and is rated as
        &quot;Pass&quot;, &quot;Fail&quot; or &quot;Honours'.</p>
    <h2 id="academic-exemption-credit-for-prior-learning--cpl">Academic Exemption (Credit for Prior Learning – CPL)</h2>
    <p>A former student of Academy of Learning® Career College may be able to have credits from a previous course or program they have completed within the last 24 months applied to a new program. All qualified credits will be utilized in shortening the
        program and the tuition fees accordingly. These credits from a previous program will appear on the new transcript.</p>
    <p>CPL may also be granted from other previous and related education, training, and/or work experience. Transcripts, related course outlines, employment portfolios or resumes must be submitted for individual assessment and review, during the admission
        process. These marks will also appear on the student's Academy of Learning® Career College transcript.</p>
    <p><em>Note: If the document(s) provided does not contain a grade/percentage, or the level of proficiency cannot be determined, a passing mark of 75% will be given to the course(s) granted CPL. This review is at the sole discretion of the college.</em></p>
    <p>The prospect student may also complete challenge examinations, which indicate acceptable levels of proficiency in specific skill areas. A charge will be applied for these examinations and a score of 75% or greater must be achieved to be considered
        for the credit. Challenge marks do appear on the student's Academy transcript. No textbooks, workbooks, or notes are issued for courses that were challenged.</p>
    <p>Students wishing to enroll in the advanced level of a specific course within a career program must first write the test for the basic level. If the student achieves a passing mark of 75% or more, they may begin the next level of that course. Should
        the student not achieve a passing grade (75%) on the challenge exam, the course will have to be taken and the regular price.</p>
    <p>Credits earned through either prior learning or challenges can qualify for only up to a maximum of 40% of the selected program.</p>

    <h2 id="academic-probation">Academic Probation</h2>
    <p>Most diploma programs require a 75% overall mark to graduate.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Different programs may have different passing mark requirements. Please speak to your Learning Coach for course minimums for your program.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A student may be placed on academic probation if their cumulative average falls below the standard minimum of 75% or there is evidence of excessive lateness or problematic attendance.</p>
    <p>While on probation, a student must show furthered commitment and effort towards their studies and attendance. Students on probation are expected to achieve a minimum grade of 75% for the duration of their probationary period and/or show significant
        improvement in attendance.</p>
    <p>At the end of the probationary period, the student's performance or attendance will be reviewed. If the probationary requirements have been met, the student will be removed from active probation.</p>
    <p>If the student does not meet the probationary requirements, the probationary period may not be extended, and the student withdrawn from the program.</p>
    <p>A student wishing to appeal the determination must do so in writing explaining why the student deserves further consideration.</p>
    <p><em>Note: we</em> <em>always</em> <em>recommend seeking advice from your Learning Coach or other staff member when you are having trouble. It is much easier to assist right away and not let the issue(s) become overwhelming.</em></p>
    <h2 id="mitigating-circumstances">Mitigating Circumstances</h2>
    <p>The college reserves the right to make exceptions on a discretionary basis to any of its policies actions based on specific mitigating circumstances, which may exist regarding students. If the college determines that mitigating circumstances prevent
        students from meeting any of the administrative standards or criteria, alternative arrangements for meeting these standards or criteria can be made on an individual basis by the Director.</p>
    <h2 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h2>
    <p>The Academy of Learning® Career College's flexibility allows you to work at your own pace. You may select the hours of attendance that suit your circumstances, but this is subject to workstation availability and within the college's hours of operation.
        The minimum weekly hours you wish to attend is considered and agreed to at the time of enrollment. However, this is subject to the program's registration as set out by the ministry and your funding source. You may put in additional hours before
        your end dates providing arrangements have been made to reserve a workstation for this purpose.</p>
    <p>No refund of tuition will be given for occasional absences from classes. The student is obligated to complete the program of study within the time frame determined as the end date and the college's guidelines for completing individual courses. During
        the term of the contract, a student's progress is evaluated, and changes may be considered and recommended to adjust for the pace of the student, and his or her attendance and progress requirements.</p>
    <p>Regular attendance is not only a good habit, it is also important in terms of your professional growth. In addition, there is often a direct relationship between regular attendance and academic success. A permanent record of your attendance will be
        kept.
    </p>
    <p>Please give as much advance notice as you can, if you are unable to attend class. You may be placed on probation or dismissed if there is a record of excessive absenteeism. If you are receiving financial aid, please see the <a href="#student-aid-bc-loan-requirements">Student Aid BC Loan Requirements section</a>,
        and <a href="#other-funding-sources">Other Funding Sources section</a> for specific details regarding their attendance requirements. We encourage you to clarify any questions with the Admissions Representative at your campus.</p>
    <h2 id="attendance-records">Attendance Records</h2>
    <p>Each day you attend the college, when you come in and when you leave for the day, you must record your attendance on the school's <em>attendance computer</em> located near the reception. You will be shown how to log in and log out on your first day
        of class. As these records are confidential, you must not share your user identity and password with anyone. For accuracy, please ensure you are assigning your time in class to the course(s) you are working on.</p>

    <p>Students must treat their training as they would an employment situation. As in any job, you are required to &quot;watch the clock&quot; when you take lunch or coffee breaks. A 15-minute, mid-morning or midafternoon coffee break is usually given at
        work, so get used to this now and ensure you return to class promptly. If a student requires an extended break, he/she must obtain permission from the Learning Coach or Instructor and <em>must log out</em> when leaving and log in upon returning
        to class. If a student fails to notify the college staff, the Learning Coaches or Instructors have the authority to log you out from the attendance computer, or deduct time from your daily attendance, to ensure the accuracy of your attendance
        records.

    <p>To stay eligible for Student Aid BC loans or grants, you must attend school full-time* for the entire study period for which you have received funding.</p>
    <p><em>*Full-time is at least 60% of the full course load (40% for students with permanent disabilities) for at least 12 consecutive weeks. At AOLCC, it translates to minimum weekly hours of 20, or more, varies by programs.</em></p>
    <p>If you stop attending classes, drop below your required course load, or fail to maintain the minimum number of weekly instructional hours for workshops/clinical placements for your entire study period, but you do not formally withdraw from school,
        you may still be considered withdrawn for student assistance purposes.</p>
    <p>You will be considered withdrawn if:</p>

        <li>You miss two consecutive weeks or 10 instructional days of study (no attendance), or</li>
        <li>You drop below 60% of a full-time course load for three consecutive weeks of study, or</li>
        <li>You miss 20% of the program of study in total, or</li>
        <li>You miss enough classes that school officials feel you cannot successfully complete the program</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The college is required to report students' attendance to Student Aid BC and will report the student as withdrawn if the above conditions are met.</p>
    <p>If you withdraw from school two times while receiving B.C. student financial assistance, you will be denied further funding by Student Aid BC.</p>
    <h2 id="other-funding-sources">Other Funding Sources</h2>
    <p>Please be advised that every funding agency has their own set of requirements regarding minimum attendance. These requirements will be reviewed with you by your funder and again at the time you enroll. If you do not maintain your attendance, the college
        is required to advise your funding agency. You may then be assumed to have withdrawn, your program cancelled and may be expected to return all or a portion of your payments. Should you require further clarification, please speak to the Admissions
        Department or the Campus Director.</p>
    <p>The college provides attendance record and progress reports on a periodic basis to sponsoring agencies, if required, on behalf of students. This lets the college, the student, and the agency know if the student is behind or ahead of schedule.</p>
    <p>Please note that attendance and progress records may be subject to scrutiny by sponsoring agencies and are maintained by the college as prescribed.</p>
    <h2 id="learning-from-home--hybrid-learning">Learning from Home / Hybrid Learning</h2>
    <p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Academy of Learning® Career College has updated its Integrated Learning System® (ILS®) to allow for Learning from Home and Hybrid Learning. Hybrid Learning is a combination of Learning from Home and Learning on
        Campus.
    </p>
    <p>The advantage of Learning from Home is that you can access your courses and even the final exams from home using the same myAOLCC Learning Hub that you use at the campus.</p>
    <p>Regular attendance is still required. However, Learning from Home allows you to spread your hours across all 7 days instead of just Monday to Friday. And you can work on your courses in the evening, after the kids have gone to bed.</p>
    <p>While working from home, you still have the same support that you get at the campus during regular campus hours. If you have any questions outside of the campus hours, you can send an email to your Learning Coach or leave a voicemail, and a qualified
        learning coach will return your message during the next school day.</p>
    <h3 id="software-and-hardware-requirements">Software and Hardware Requirements</h3>
    <p>In order to complete your courses from home, there are certain technical requirements that must be met. <br> These requirements may change at any point. If you are unsure, please ask your learning coach.</p>
    <p><em>Note: These requirements are only for Learning from Home. All Academy of Learning® Career College campuses are equipped with the hardware and software required to complete your courses.</em></p>

    <h3 id="purpose-statement">Purpose Statement</h3>
    <p>Academy of Learning® Career College wishes to confirm its responsibility to provide a safe and secure learning environment. At Academy of Learning® Career College, we firmly believe that there should be a safe environment for all the students, which
        is free from any kind of sexual misconduct as the college has zero tolerance towards this kind of misconduct.</p>
    <p>Through this policy the institutions strive to prevent sexual misconduct and create a procedure to respond effectively and in a timely manner when incidents occur.</p>
    <p>In 2016 the Government of BC introduced the Sexual Violence and Misconduct Policy Act S.B.C. c.23 (the Act). The Act requires BC post secondary institutions to establish, implement, and make publicly available a policy, with associated procedures,
        that addresses sexual misconduct, its prevention, and responses to sexual misconduct. This Policy has been designed in compliance with the Act.</p>
    <h3 id="scope-and-application">Scope and Application</h3>
    <p>The policy applies to students, faculty and staff members working at Academy of Learning® Career College as well as extends to the visitors, volunteers and contractors at the campus, who may be found involved in any act of violating the respectful
        environment of the college by indulging in any sexual violence or misconduct.</p>
    <p>Sexual misconduct is defined as any form of undesired activity of a sexual nature which intends to violate the sexual integrity of the individual to whom it is directed. Sexual assault is characterized by a broad range of behaviors that involve the
        use of coercion, threats or control towards a person which makes the person feel uncomfortable, distressed, frightened.</p>
    <p>Sexual misconduct may involve:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sexual Assault</li>
        <li>Sexual Exploitation</li>
        <li>Sexual Harassment</li>
        <li>Stalking</li>
        <li>Incident Exposure</li>
        <li>Voyeurism</li>
        <li>Distribution of a sexually explicit photograph or video of a person, without the consent of the person in the photo or video.</li>
        <li>Attempt to commit an act of sexual misconduct</li>
        <li>Threat to commit an act of sexual misconduct.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="reportingdisclosure-procedure">Reporting/Disclosure Procedure</h3>
    <p>The person who wishes to disclose sexual misconduct or make a formal report against it may do so as per the following process:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The person (victim) may choose to disclose the sexual misconduct to the Executive Director/SEA of Academy of Learning® Career College, without making a formal report. In this case a formal process may not be initiated, but the management will
            deal with the disclosure seriously and may take steps to avoid the repetition of the incident.</li>
        <li>To initiate a formal process, the victim or a member of the college community, on behalf of the victim, needs to submit a report in writing to the Executive Director/ Senior Educational Administrator of Academy of Learning® Career College, stating
            as clearly as possible the details of the incident, including the details of the people involved in the misconduct, along with a request for an action. The report must clearly state the allegations against the alleged person involved in the
            sexual misconduct. 1.The Executive Director/SEA will, within 24 hours of receiving the complaint, initiate an investigation to the complaint and may ask for more information from the complainant.</li>
        <li>Depending on the severity of complain, the SEA may seek legal advice or may ask the complainant to follow a legal process besides the complaint filed at the Academy of Learning® Career College.</li>
        <li>The person against whom allegations are made will be informed about the same, keeping the name and details of the complainant private. The person will be given 24 hours’ time to submit written explanation about the incident. The SEA of Academy
            of Learning® Career College will then verify all the available evidence and if found guilty, the alleged perpetrator will be asked to offer a written apology to the complainant and will also be expelled from work/study (as the case may be).</li>
        <li>If the perpetrator is a visitor, whom the Academy of Learning® Career College authorities cannot access, the information of the visitor will be given to the local police along with the copy of the complaint, if the complainant agrees to this.</li>
        <li>The information of the complainant will be kept confidential according to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, unless, it becomes mandatory by law to disclose the information to get full justice to the complainant. If required,
            the complainant will be given to counseling or emergency medical care to overcome the mental or physical problems faced by the complainant due to the incident.</li>

        If you feel that you are not being treated in a fair and respectful manner, please feel free to discuss this with a staff member or Campus Director.</p>
    <p>We strive to provide more than skills training to our students. We hope that our students will be exposed to all aspects of the workplace, including the requirement of appropriate professional conduct. For these reasons, we reserve the right to start
        disciplinary action if we deem a student's work ethics or conduct unsatisfactory.</p>

    <p>If you have good reason to believe you are being harassed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ask the offender to stop: As harassment is often unintentional, asking to stop the behavior often puts an end to the harassment. The best way to deal with it is to assertively tell the person(s) that their behavior is unwelcome or offensive and
            must stop.</li>
        <li>Seek assistance: If the person persists in the behavior that you deem to be harassing, seek assistance by reporting the incident to the Director. The company harassment policy will become effective.</li>

    <p>Grievances by any student that pertains to Academy of Learning® Career College, the Executive Director(s), any other student, or staff member, will require the following procedure.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Initially, students should always try to resolve the issue informally and promptly by taking to the other party involved. If the issue cannot be resolved, the student should schedule a meeting with one of the Executive Director (Alda Messiah)
                to discuss the situation. The Executive Director will be responsible for making the determination in the respect to the complaint. If one of the Executive Director's are absent or named in the complaint, the other Executive Director will
                then be responsible for deciding in respect of the complaint.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Should the student be unable to resolve the grievance satisfactorily, the grievance should be addressed formally, in writing, to an Executive Director (Alda Messiah).Written submission of the grievance should include a detailed and clear description
                of the grievance and include all relevant information, such as the <em>nature of the problem</em>, <em>date of occurrences(s)</em>, and <em>names(s) of parties involved</em>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The Executive Director (Alda Messiah) should then request similar submissions from all other involved parties and should attempt to resolve the grievance within five (5) business days of receipt of all written submissions. The Executive Director
                should orally communicate a decision then follow with a written decision to the student.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If the Executive Director (Alda Messiah) is unable to resolve the grievance, the student then may choose to submit the grievance in writing, and including all relevant information and the Executive Director's decision, to the Franchisor at
                the address below for immediate review:</p>
        </li>

    <ol>
        <li>The Franchisor will investigate the student's grievance within ten (10) business days. If required, arrangements for further communication, i.e. conference calls or face-to-face meetings, will be made with the campus. All aspects of the dispute
            resolution will be completed within 45 days from the start of the student making a written complaint to completing the entire process including appeal/arbitration. A final written decision will be issued to the student, and the Executive Director
            will be notified of the outcome.</li>
        <li>Students making a complaint may be represented by an agent or lawyer.</li>
        <li>Students will not be subject to any retaliation as a result of their complaint.</li>
        <li>If a mutually satisfying resolution cannot be reached, the student may file a claim with the Private Training Institutions Branch of the Ministry of Advanced Education on the basis that the institution misled the student regarding any significant
            aspect of an approved program.</li>

    <h1 id="tests-and-final-examinations">Tests and Final Examinations</h1>
    <p>There are usually two components to exams: A Practical Pre-test which tests your practical knowledge of the course and must be looked at by a Learning Coach before you may proceed. Secondly, an Online Multiple-choice Exam - which tests your theoretical
        knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>These exams are normally scheduled for the last day of the course. Practical tests must also be completed before the final examination.</p>
    <p>Additional in-class tests or quizzes are left to the discretion of the Learning Coach or Instructor. You will receive your results almost immediately, along with feedback on areas that may need further review.</p>
    <p>Learning Coach or Instructor will advise you on your exam dates. Depends on the course, if you have completed the study material ahead of schedule, you are encouraged to advise the Learning Coach that you wish to take your exam early.</p>
    <h2 id="exam-procedures">Exam Procedures</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>One day before the exam, please speak to a Learning Coach. He/she will help you understand what is expected in the exam and prepare your exam in advance.</li>
        <li>If applicable, textbooks, workbooks, notebooks, and related study materials must be handed in. Unless otherwise stated, all exams are closed book. The study materials also include, but not limited to electronic documents, web search results, online
            video/audio files, etc. You may use your computer or program built-in Help function and test your answers with the relevant program.</li>
        <li>Do not remove Practical Pre-test from their covers and do not mark the covers of the exam pages.</li>
        <li>You may ask questions during an exam regarding the interpretation of exam questions. Answers will be limited to only those questions which pertain to interpretation of the exam questions.</li>
        <li>You may not ask Learning Coaches to check your answers prior submitting to Head Office.</li>
        <li>You may not ask another student(s) for help. If another student(s) wishes to offer help during your exam, please respectfully decline.</li>
        <li>You are not allowed to leave the classroom during an exam. You may leave once the examination session is finished, and when you have submitted the exam. In case of emergencies, the college will interrupt the exam.</li>
        <li>No time extensions will be given on a test or exam. All tests and exams must be completed within the official time allotted. Unless approved by a Director, all exams must be completed and submitted the same day. No additional time will be given
            for a test or exam if the student is late.</li>
        <li>You are responsible to schedule enough time to complete your exams in advance. Online Multiple-Choice Exams must be started 3 hours before closing time; therefore, if the campus closes at 5:00pm, then no exams should be started after 2:00pm. If
            a course has a Practical Pre-test, it must be complete before the Online Multiple-Choice Exam. In the above example, you may need to start your exam at 1:00pm.</li>
        <li>If you are absent for a test or exam without enough reason, you will receive a grade of zero. If you had special circumstances, a letter outlining the reasons must be submitted to the campus director within three business days of the examination
            date. If your appeal is approved, only one date will be arranged for a make-up test/exam. Failure to write a make-up test/exam as scheduled will result in a grade of zero, which is not open to appeal.</li>
        <li>Should any examination be cancelled due to extreme weather conditions, alternate arrangements will be made by the college to reschedule the examination.</li>
        <li>If a student is caught cheating, their exam will be confiscated and submitted incomplete to Head Office for marking. If Head Office or the campus determines that a student has cheated on an exam, the matter will be further investigated. Depending
            on the circumstances, the student may fail the exam and suspension from the program or expulsion from the centre will be considered.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Learning Coaches/Instructors reserve the right to refuse an exam to a student if they believe;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The student has not achieved the necessary proficiency in the program to pass the exam.</li>
        <li>The student lacks the necessary time required to write the exam.</li>
        <li>The student has not done the necessary review to successfully complete a rewrite of an exam.</li>
        <li>The student is under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="exam-passing-marks">Exam Passing Marks</h2>
    <p>Academic requirements for all approved diploma and certificate programs require a minimum final exam mark of 60% in any one subject, while maintaining an overall average of 75%. Students achieving a mark of 90% and higher will pass their course(s)
        with Honors. A mark below 60% will automatically require a rewrite.</p>
    <p>You must ensure that your overall average is acceptable. If your average falls below 75%, you may be asked to stop taking new courses and rewrite exams to bring your average up.</p>
    <p>As for individual courses, you must achieve a 75% mark or greater for a single course for an individual Certificate to be awarded.</p>
    <h2 id="exam-re-writes">Exam Re-writes</h2>
    <p>If a student receives a mark between 60% and 74% on a subject, one rewrite is permitted without charge. After one rewrite, a $30 fee will apply to future rewrites. In any rewrites, the total mark available will be a maximum of 89%.This is because
        a rewrite is not considered honors.</p>
    <p>Academy of Learning® Career College develops examinations to test the student's knowledge or ability to use the skills they have learned. Should the student fail at the second attempt(s), he/she will need to repeat the course; however, regular fees
        will apply.</p>
    <h2 id="exam-appeal-policy">Exam Appeal Policy</h2>
    <p>Academy of Learning® Career College has established an exam appeal procedure for a reassessment of a student's exam. When the Director, Learning Coach or the student queries a question or feels that a question on an exam was marked incorrectly, according
        to the courseware studied, the Director or Learning Coach, if they agree that the student's claim is legitimate, will submit a Petition to the Help Desk.</p>
    <p>Help Desk is a method for college staff to communicate with the Academic Division of LaunchLife™ International Inc. If there is a Petition with any of the Online Multiple-Choice exams, attention is immediately drawn to the problem question. Wording
        of the question as well as the selection of responses are reviewed and re-assessed. If the Petition is successful, marks are adjusted to compensate the student accordingly. If a Petition is unsuccessful, an explanation will be provided to validate
        both the question and the correct answer(s).</p>
    <p>If a grade appeal is raised by a student enrolled in third-party program, the Learning Coach can contact the Academic Division of LaunchLife™ International Inc. via the Help Desk using the Course Query function. The Academic Division reviews the student's
        appeal and will direct it to the appropriate third-party provider. Subsequently, the third-party provider will review the appeal, will decide, and will then report back to the Academic Division. The final decision of the grade appeal will be reported
        back to the Learning Coach by way of the Academic Division.</p>
    <h2 id="academic-dishonesty">Academic Dishonesty</h2>
    <p>Academic Dishonesty, such as cheating, copying, plagiarism, collaboration, on assignments, tests or exams will not be tolerated. Any student caught acting dishonestly will face the following penalties:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First offence: zero on the assignment, test, or exam</li>
        <li>Second offence: expulsion</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you have attained a grade of less than 60% in a course, (marks may vary by registered diploma program and registered certificate program) or you have obtained a credit (60% or more) in every course but do not meet the graduation requirements (average
        of 75% or more), you may be allowed to repeat a course. It is important to note that the course repeat is a privilege you must earn. Your eligibility is determined at a formal interview with the director of the college.</p>
    <p>Where possible, the course to be repeated will be rescheduled after you have completed the balance of your program. The college will make an exception when the course to be repeated is a prerequisite to one or more courses. Please note that there
        may be a fee for the tuition, course material, and/or the current textbook.</p>
    <p><em>Please note the minimum grade required for graduation may vary by program.</em></p>
    <h1 id="textbooks-lab-fees-and-supplies">Textbooks, Lab Fees and Supplies</h1>
    <p>All courses are delivered as complete learning packages, including all the required materials. Our student textbooks/manuals and corresponding multimedia presentations form the foundation of our learning system. Each multimedia presentation has been
