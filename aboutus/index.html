                <h1>ABOUT ACADEMY OF LEARNING CAREER COLLEGE (AOLCC)</h1>
                <h3>Our History</h3>
                <hr class="lefthr" />
                <p>Founded as a franchise system in 1987, Academy of Learning&reg; Career College originally specialized in computer and business skills training for adult learners, based on the Integrated Learning™ System ("ILSTM"). This system is unique
                    to Canada and offers a method of learning whereby course materials and instruction provide an all-encompassing learning experience using multi-sensory learning styles and preferences through student workbooks, media presentations and
                    hands-on exercises. These learning styles are supported by an on-site qualified Campus Facilitator. ILS is exclusive to Academy of Learning&reg; College.</p>

                <p>Beginning in the 1990s, some Academy of Learning&reg; Career College campuses also offer lesson content delivered to students in a vibrant, interactive classroom community. These courses follow the traditional delivery of content by an
                    Instructor, based on daily standardized lesson plans that consist of approved curriculum. When using this method of delivery, the instructor engages the class, provides individual coaching to help students gain the skills and knowledge
                    they need to succeed, actively monitors their progress, and is ready to address their questions and concerns.</p>

                <p> In more recent years, Academy of Learning&reg; Career College adopted"e&#8209;learning"technology as an extension of the Integrated Learning™ System. Students complete course materials presented within a comprehensive Academy Online system.
                    This system incorporates online presentations, tutorials and media that combine with access to instructional materials, simulated labs, exercises, as well as quizzes, review questions, or pre- and post-tests. In this delivery method,
                    students are supported by a qualified Online Instructor or an on-site qualified campus Facilitator.</p>

                <p>Additionally, Academy of Learning Career College has continued meeting adult learners' changing needs by leveraging technology to offer an innovative method of learning – virtual learning. Students have the opportunity to learn and participate
                    in a Virtual Classroom and participate in a live session with their instructor every day. Students also master the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their future careers through online digital media, textbooks, and software
                    programs. A community of like-minded learners who are also changing their lives is just a click away!</p>

                <p>Today, over 50 Academy of Learning&reg; College campuses, from British Columbia to Prince Edward Island, have helped students successfully completed over one million training courses. Depending on the province or territory, program offerings
                    have expanded to Diploma-level and Certificate-level programs in the areas of Accounting, Business, Community Support Worker, Customer Service, Healthcare, Information Technology, Office Administration, Graphic Design and Web Design.
                </p>

                <p>New programs and courses are continuously being developed to ensure that students receive current skills that will enable them to be successful in the marketplace, while working to better their lives. </p>

                <p>For more than 30 years, Academy of Learning&reg; Career College's main focal point has always been and continues to be the student. It provides methods of learning that will fulfil students' needs, as well as the requirements of today's
                    competitive job market. AOLCC has helped learners successfully complete over one million training courses.
