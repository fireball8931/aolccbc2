    <h1>Academic Probation</h1>
    <p>Most diploma programs require a 75% overall mark to graduate.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class='level3'>Different programs may have different passing mark requirements. Please speak to your Learning Coach for course minimums for your program.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A student may be placed on academic probation if their cumulative average falls below the standard minimum of 75% or there is evidence of excessive lateness or problematic attendance.</p>
    <p>While on probation, a student must show furthered commitment and effort towards their studies and attendance. Students on probation are expected to achieve a minimum grade of 75% for the duration of their probationary period and/or show
    significant improvement in attendance.</p>
    <p>At the end of the probationary period, the studentâ€™s performance or attendance will be reviewed. If the probationary requirements have been met, the student will be removed from active probation.</p>
    <p>If the student does not meet the probationary requirements, the probationary period may not be extended, and the student withdrawn from the program.</p>
    <p>A student wishing to appeal the determination must do so in writing explaining why the student deserves further consideration.</p>
    <p class='notes'>Note: we <u>always</u> recommend seeking advice from your Learning Coach or other staff member when you are having trouble. It is much easier to assist right away and not let the issue(s) become overwhelming.</p>
