            <p>Please be advised that every funding agency has their own set of requirements regarding minimum attendance. These requirements will be reviewed with you by your funder and again at the time you enroll. If you do not maintain your attendance,
                the college is required to advise your funding agency. You may then be assumed to have withdrawn, your program cancelled and may be expected to return all or a portion of your payments. Should you require further clarification, please
                speak to the Admissions Department or the Campus Director.</p>
            <p>The college provides attendance record and progress reports on a periodic basis to sponsoring agencies, if required, on behalf of students. This lets the college, the student, and the agency know if the student is behind or ahead of schedule.
                Please note that attendance and progress records may be subject to scrutiny by sponsoring agencies and are maintained by the college as prescribed.</p>
