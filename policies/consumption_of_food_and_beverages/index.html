    <h1>Our Training Philosophy</h1>
    <p>You will find when you begin your classes that the people who make up the student body come from a wide range of backgrounds. Each person brings a life experience that can and should be shared.</p>
    <p>Your time at AOLCC will help you make the transition from your high school days, your homemaking days or your past job experiences to a new career. By the time you graduate, you will have acquired the technical skills and work habits that are
    required for employment success.</p>
    <p>Our programs are designed not only to develop technical skills but also to develop the qualities that employers want, initiative, discipline, the ability to solve problems and to be able to work independently. For this reason, we
    intentionally create and foster an office-like environment in our classroom. Consequently, our codes of conduct, policies and regulations have been developed with the ‚Äúemployer-employee‚Äù relationship in mind.</p>
    <p>In addition to the qualities listed above, employers want employees with great attitudes. Attitudes cannot be taught; they can only be refined. It is for this reason that we place much of the responsibility for your progress squarely on
    you.</p>
