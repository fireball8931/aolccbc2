            <p>The college reserves the right to make exceptions on a discretionary basis to any of its policies actions based on specific mitigating circumstances, which may exist regarding students. If the college determines that mitigating circumstances
                prevent students from meeting any of the administrative standards or criteria, alternative arrangements for meeting these standards or criteria can be made on an individual basis by the Director.</p>
