            <h1>Transfer Policy</h1>
            <p>Students are expected to complete their program of study at the Academy of Learning&reg; Career College identified on their contract. Under no circumstances can course or program registrations be transferred to another individual.</p>
            <p>If you wish to transfer to another Academy of Learning&reg; Career College, you must request this in writing from our campus in advance, but we cannot guarantee that a transfer will be made. Transfers will only be considered if the student
                is in good standing and are at the sole discretion of the campus director. This policy may be subject to approval from your funding agency and is subject to space availability and acceptance by the campus to which you want to transfer.</p>
