            <h2>Student Aid BC Loan Requirements</h2>
            <p>To stay eligible for Student Aid BC loans or grants, you must attend school full-time* for the entire study period for which you have received funding.</p>
            <p class="notes">*Full-time is at least 60% of the full course load (40% for students with permanent disabilities) for at least 12 consecutive weeks. At AOLCC, it translates to minimum weekly hours of 20, or more, varies by programs.</p>
            <p>If you stop attending classes, drop below your required course load, or fail to maintain the minimum number of weekly instructional hours for workshops/clinical placements for your entire study period, but you do not formally withdraw from
                school, you may still be considered withdrawn for student assistance purposes.</p>
            <p>You will be considered withdrawn if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="level3">You miss two consecutive weeks or 10 instructional days of study (no attendance), or</li>
                <li class="level3">You drop below 60% of a full-time course load for three consecutive weeks of study, or</li>
                <li class="level3">You miss 20% of the program of study in total, or</li>
                <li class="level3">You miss enough classes that school officials feel you cannot successfully complete the program</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The college is required to report studentsâ€™ attendance to Student Aid BC and will report the student as withdrawn if the above conditions are met.</p>
            <p>If you withdraw from school two times while receiving B.C. student financial assistance, you will be denied further funding by Student Aid BC.</p>
