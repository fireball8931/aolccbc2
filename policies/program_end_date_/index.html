            <h1>Program End Date & Extensions</h1>
            <p>Your program end date is specified on your Enrolment Contract. Students are expected to complete all the courses in their registered diploma or registered certificate program outline by this date. You may need to schedule extra time to adhere
                to your timetable and complete your diploma or certificate on the scheduled end date of your program.</p>
            <p>For those students funded through a third party – Workers’ Compensation, First Nations, Insurance, or Corporate, if completion by the scheduled end date is not possible, and with the permission of the third-party funder and the Campus Director,
                this end date may be extended. An additional charge may occur. A valid reason must exist, such as sickness, converting to part-time due to work obligations etc. Any application for an extension must be made well in advance of the end date
                and must be provided to the Director of the college in writing. The length of the extension will be at the sole discretion of the Director of the college.</p>
            <p>Courses not completed within this period will not qualify for any refunds or transfers. Textbooks for courses not started will not be issued after this period has elapsed.</p>
